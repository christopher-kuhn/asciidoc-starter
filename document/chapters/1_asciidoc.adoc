= About AsciiDoc

AsciiDoc is a superset of Markdown with some modifications.
Like markdown, documents are written in plain text (extension .adoc) and rendered to an output format (html, pdf, docx, etc.), if needed.
Having the source in plain text allows easy version control (git) of AsciiDoc documents.
Plain text also allows choosing your favorite text editor. 

AsciiDoc is intentionally as simple as possible to enable quick learning and to allow focus on writing.
You can try it https://asciidoclive.com/[live in your browser].
It has been developed for publishing all kinds of content to the web, to books, to manuals, and more.
See an example document in https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-article/[plain] and https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.org/blob/master/docs/_includes/asciidoc-article-template.adoc[rendered] format, respectively.

There is a wide variety of AsciiDoc projects and widespread support for the AsciiDoc format.
Prominent examples include 

* O'Reilly books  
* The git book (HTML and printed)  
* Khronos documentation  
* GitHub and GitLab 

AsciiDoc and git are open source, therefore they make MPEG independent of a companyâ€™s rule. 

AsciiDoc supports automatic conversion to html, pdf, docx (Word), and other formats.
Conversion can be done with one command.
Html and pdf are the main target formats, they support perfect conversion.
Conversion to Word is not perfect, but good: general style, sections, images, math, references are all correct.
